# 01 HTML, CSS and Git: Code Refactor 
## Week 1 Challenge

For this challenge,  we were given a starter code that needed modification, or to be refactored. The challenge's acceptance criteria expected us to make the webpage meet accessibility standards by adding accessible alt attributes; we also had to add semantic HTML elements, a descriptive title, and make sure the structute of the HTML elements followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning and have the heading attributes follow a sequential order.
