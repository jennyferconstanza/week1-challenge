# 01 HTML, CSS and Git: Code Refactor 
## Week 1 Challenge

For this challenge,  we were given a starter code that needed modification, or to be refactored. The challenge's acceptance criteria expected us to make the webpage meet accessibility standards by adding accessible alt attributes, adding semantic HTML elements, adding a descriptive title as well as making sure the structute of the HTML elements followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning and having the heading attributes follow a sequential order.
